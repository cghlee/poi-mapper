# PoI Mapper

A project created to enable mapping of a large number of points of interest
(PoIs) for a given location to enable easier visualisation of routing between
PoIs, and easier identification of PoIs on the fly (e.g. for nearby spots to
sightsee, have lunch or dinner, or grab a drink).

The PoI Mapper outputs an interactive map in HTML format to either locally
store for offline access, or for hosting online as a static web page.

## Dependencies

PoI Mapper requires the `Folium` module, with relevant documentation linked
